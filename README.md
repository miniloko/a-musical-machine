#A musical machine

A personal experiment exploring some of the features of the Web Audio API. I also wanted to try out some ES6 code.

##Trying it out

Right now, I have a [demo here]. If you want to try locally, just do the `npm install` dance and run `gulp` - serve with a server of your choice. Built files are included and ready to be run directly from `./dist`.

###Known issues

* On the iOS devices I've tested, the wet/dry mixing is broken - the sounds are 100% wet.
